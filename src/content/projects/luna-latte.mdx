Ever since I got into programming, I've been dreaming of making a website for my own business. My passion for <span>technology</span> and <span>coffee</span> inspired me to start this project. The goal is to create a <span>unique online presence</span> for our coffee business that also offers a <span>streamlined online-ordering experience</span>.

<br />

By integrating Meta's Messenger, I aim to build a platform that makes it easier and more enjoyable for our customers here in Philippines ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ to <span>order their favorite coffee from the comfort of their homes</span>.
