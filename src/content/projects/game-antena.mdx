Game-Antena is the first freelance project I've ever worked on. My client had already developed the initial website, <span><a class="underline" href="https://old.game-antena.com" target="_blank">check it here</a> </span>. My task was to <span>improve every aspects of it and take his existing ideas into a real working app.</span>

<br />

After a span of 3 months, the MVP was done and ready to be launch on public. The
project is still ongoing as there's still extra requirements to be submitted on Google
for the app verification.
