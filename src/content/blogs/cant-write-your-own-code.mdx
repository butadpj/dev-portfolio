## [The struggle](#the-struggle)

I know the struggle, I've been there. You have finished bunch of coding tutorials and now, it's time to
apply what you just learned. -_"But wait, did I even learn anything? I literally have no idea what to write in my IDE_ ðŸ˜­" -
That was my everday scenario when I was just starting to learn how to code.

But really, why do begginers struggle to write their own code? The only reason for this is
**lack of deep understanding** about the small parts of programming, most importantly, **fundamentals**.
Having a deep understanding of programming fundamentals looks like this.

- You can decompose complex problems into smaller, manageable parts and solve them step-by-step. (Analyzation)
- You can easily remember the basic concepts (variables, loops, conditionals, etc.), and apply them when necessary. (Retrieval and Application)
- Of course, you can write solutions on your own (Creation)

Good news! I'm here to tell you that you can easily gain deep understanding about a certain topic
if you avoid these three (3) big mistakes when learning programming. But first, let's take a look at this
analogy.

## [Analogy: The puzzle](#analogy-the-puzzle)

Learning is pretty similar to solving a puzzle. There are some things that if you don't have or you don't do, then, solving
the puzzle is going to be a lot harder.

- Not having a picture or guide of the final outcmoe to look at
- Not focusing on small and destinct sections (Attempting to solve the entire puzzle)
- Not having the patience to solve the puzzle makes you want to quit

Same thing goes for learning, you avoid these mistakes and learning will be much easier.

## [Mistake #1: Unstructured learning](#mistake-1-unstructured-learning)

Remember this - **"Our brain hates chaos"** - If your brain can only shout to you everytime
you commit to unstrucuted learning, you may already be the most efficient learner by now. But no, it can only
send signals. _Sleepy_, _distracted_, and _unmotivated_ when you're studying? Those are the clear signs.

### The fix: Setting a clear goal

The best you can do, before you even start looking for coding tutorials, is **setting a clear goal**.
It's like having a picture or guide of the final outcome, so that you can spend your time and effort wisely
on topics that matter and avoid wasting time on topics that don't.

Look at the table below to differentiate "not so clear" goals from clear goals.

| "Not so clear" goals           | Clear goals                                                          |
| :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "I will build a website."      | "I will build an ecommerce store for my friend's business."          |
| "I will build a simple game."  | "I will build a console-based rock, paper, scissors game."           |
| "I will be backend developer." | "I will build a secured, public API for generating random pictures." |

So, if your goals are "not so clear" ones, it's an indication that you need to ask yourself more questions
and you also need to do more research first.

- **Who:** Who is the end user or beneficiary after you achieve the goal?
- **What:** What are the things needed to achieve the goal?
- **When:** When is the estimated accomplishment time?
- **Why:** Why is this goal important? What problem does it solve?
- **How:** How will you achieve the goal? What tools or technologies will you use?

Now, everything is clear, you have **more focus and less distraction**. You can filter out irrelevant
topics much easier and focus more on the most important ones. That way, you avoid doing the second mistake
which is overwhelming yourself with big and complex chunks of information.

## [Mistake #2: Overwhelming yourself](#mistake-2-overwhelming-yourself)

You have probably heard these phrases before - **_"One step at a time"_**, **_"Slowly but surely"_** -
Those are in fact, what you need to do when learning programming. Also, if you really think about it,
you never really learned "Reading". First, what you have learned is recognizing patterns.
Then, linking patterns to letters. Then, you learn the sound of each letter up until,
you learn the sound of different letter combinations. You were making baby steps when you were
learning how to read.

If you can't zoom-in into complex topic or problem and start focusing on smaller parts of it, you're going to
overwhelm your brain, which leads to <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/cognitive-overload#:~:text=When%20there%20is%20too%20much,act%20on%20what%20is%20heard" target="_blank">cognitive overload</a>. That's the last thing you want to do to your brain when learning programming.

### The fix: Narrowing down your vision

Directing our attention to small and simple piece of the problem at a time, enhances focus and concentration.
This reduces distractions and improves the quality of our thinking. But, in order for the concentration to last,
the thing that you need to be focusing on must be aligned with your goals.

Your goals should always be the big pictures where you want to zoom-in. Let's take this goal for example -
_"I will build an ecommerce store for my friend's business"_ -. Now if you zoom-in, these are the different parts of it
that you can see.

- Platform
- Business details
- Tools and technology to be used
- Testing
- Deployment

As you start working on achieving your goal, expect that it will transform in to "more clear" or "more narrowed" goal.
Now the best part of it, is that you're going to always have a small and manageable task to work on up until the end.

Now, that you're ready to actually start the learning process, be aware that every advice I just gave you will be useless
unless you avoid this final mistake.

## [Mistake #3: Craving for comfort](#mistake-3-craving-for-comfort)

## [Conclusion](#conclusion)

I can link internally to [my introduction](#the-struggle) on the same page when writing Markdown.
But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked to a
series of rabies cases springing up around the country.
For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread
with cheese to their children, with the food earning such an iconic status in
our culture that kids will often dress up as warm, cheesy loaf for Halloween.
