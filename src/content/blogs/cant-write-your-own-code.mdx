## [The struggle](#the-struggle)

I know the struggle, I've been there. You have finished bunch of coding tutorials and now, it's time to
apply what you just learned. -_"But wait, did I learn anything? I literally have no idea what to write in my IDE_ ðŸ˜­" -
That was my everday scenario when I was just starting learning how to code.

Now that I've spent so much time optimizing the way I learn things. It's time for me to help beginners recognize
and avoid these 3 big mistakes that prevents them from writing their own code. But first, check this analogy.

## [Analogy: The puzzle](#analogy-the-puzzle)

Learning is pretty similar to solving a puzzle. There are some things that if you don't have or you don't do, then solving
the puzzle is going to be a lot harder.

- Not having a picture or guide of the final outcmoe to look at
- Not focusing on small and destinct sections (Attempting to solve the entire puzzle)
- Not having the patience to solve the puzzle makes you want to quit

Same thing goes for learning, you avoid these mistakes and learning will be much easier.

### [Mistake #1: Unstructured learning](#mistake-1-unstructured-learning)

Remember this - **"Our brain hates chaos"** - If your brain can only shout to you everytime
you commit to unstrucuted learning, you may already be the most efficient learner by now. But no, it can only
send signals. _Sleepy_, _distracted_, and _unmotivated_ when you're studying? Those are the clear signs.

#### The fix:

The best you can do, before you even start looking for coding tutorials, is **setting a clear goal**.
It's like having a picture or guide of the final outcome, so that you can spend your time and effort wisely
into the topics that matter and avoid wasting time on the topics that don't.âˆ‚

Look at the table below to differentiate "not so clear" goals from clear goals.

| "Not so clear" goals           | Clear goals                                                          |
| :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "I will build a website."      | "I will build an ecommerce store for my friend's business."          |
| "I will build a simple game."  | "I will build a console-based rock, paper, scissors game."           |
| "I will be backend developer." | "I will build a secured, public API for generating random pictures." |

So, if your goals are "not so clear" ones, it's an indication that you need to ask yourself more questions
and you also need to do more research first.

- **Who:** Who is the end user or beneficiary after you achieve the goal?
- **What:** What are the things needed to achieve the goal?
- **When:** When is the estimated accomplishment time?
- **Why:** Why is this goal important? What problem does it solve?
- **How:** How will you achieve the goal? What tools or technologies will you use?

Now, everything is clear, you have **more focus and less distraction**. You can filter out irrelevant
topics much easier and focus more on the most important ones. That way, you avoid doing the second mistake
which is overwhelming yourself with big and complex chunks of information.

### [Mistake #2: Overwhelming yourself](#mistake-2-overwhelming-yourself)

**Every topic is overwhelming if your brain is unfamiliar with it**. - _Really? So how do we learn new things
while avoiding being overwhelmed?_ If you really think about it, you never really learned "Reading".
First, what you have learned is recognizing patterns. Then, remembering those patterns as letters.
Then, you learn the sound of each letter up until, you learn the sound of different letter combinations.
In short, you have learned each small part that makes up reading.

If you can't zoom-in into complex thing and start focusing on smaller parts of it, you're going to
overwhelm your brain and our brain hates it.

I can link internally to [my introduction](#introduction) on the same page when writing Markdown.
But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked to a
series of rabies cases springing up around the country.
For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread
with cheese to their children, with the food earning such an iconic status in
our culture that kids will often dress up as warm, cheesy loaf for Halloween.
