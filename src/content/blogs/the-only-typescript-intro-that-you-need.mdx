## [Can't find good tutorials?](#cant-find-good-tutorials)

I know, it's really hard to find good tutorials out there that teaches you how to get
started with TypeScript. **Short**, **straight to the point**, while **teaching all you need to know**
so you can start using TypeScript on your future projects. Well, good news! I'm here to fill all those
gaps so let's get started.

I will assume that you already have basic knowledge of JavaScript 
and you're now wondering at how TypeScript can help you.

## [The starting point](#the-starting-point)

There's no special thing about TypeScript. It's more accurate to say, that JavaScript is lacking or
incomplete when it comes to building complex projects. Sure, you can build complex projects using only JavaScript. But, to make the **codebase
maintainable** and your **mental health "healthy"** üòú, JavaScript alone is not enough.

There's two (2) things where TypeScript is really good at, that really speeds up development time ‚ö°Ô∏è.

- _Helping you catch bugs early._
- _Helping you make big changes in the codebase very easily._

What about the trade offs? Just additional tooling setup
and additional code to write ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Well, for complex projects, especially with a team of developers working
on it, the trade offs really can't outweigh the benefits.

For every type of project you want to do, there are different ways you can
learn, setup, and use TypeScript. But, regardless of type of project you are building,
the requirements for using TypeScript are the following:

- A TypeScript compiler (tsc) or other transpilers that converts TypeScript files to JavaScript
  files such as [esbuild (20~30x faster than tsc)](https://esbuild.github.io/),
  [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), or [swc](https://swc.rs/docs/getting-started)
- Installation of <Code class="not-prose" lang="js" inline code={`typescript`}/> package for
  type checking _(this will install <Code class="not-prose" lang="js" inline code={`tsc`}/> too)_
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) for installation of the said packages.

  To use TypeScript on your plain stack web application

1. Make sure you have Node.js in your machine - [download here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
2. In your project's root directory, initialize <Code class="not-prose" inline code={`package.json`}/> file

   - <Code class="not-prose" code={`npm init -y`} inline />

3. Install TypeScript

   - <Code
       class="not-prose"
       code={`npm install typescript --save-dev`}
       inline
     />

4. Initialize <Code class="not-prose" code={`tsconfig.json`} inline /> file
   - <Code class="not-prose" code={`npx tsc --init`} inline />
