As a full-stack web developer, I've been appoaching learning DevOps the wrong way. After all,
my job was to focus on user interfaces, making apps functional, and look beautiful. But there's two (2)
things I was very wrong at. First, I thought I only need to learn it once I start working on production 
apps that already have thousands of users. Second, I thought just by doing online courses and cloud 
services certifications, I can learn DevOps. But no, here's what everyone should realize if they are 
developing web applications.

- Your web app, specifically the backend where APIs and business logic resides, **is inherintly sluggish 
during traffic spikes** (multiple users requesting resources at the same time)

- If your goal is to address the slowness of your app, that's a very strong reason to learn some basic 
DevOps concepts. Now, online courses/certifications are not going to be a huge help here, because **you 
need to start looking for solutions to a bunch of problems now, not just some roadmaps.** 

The problem is, most of developers haven't seen their web app performing poorly. Most likely, after 
the development is done, they'll just deploy it on some platform and never experience getting high traffic 
on their web app. But don't worry, let me show you an easy way for you to experience how slow your app is ðŸ˜ˆ.
