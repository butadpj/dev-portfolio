As a frontend-focused developer, I've been appoaching learning DevOps the wrong way. After all,
my job was to focus on user interfaces, making apps functional, and look beautiful. But there's two (2)
things I was very wrong at. First, I thought I only need to learn it once I start working on production 
apps that already have thousands of users. Second, I thought just by doing online courses and cloud 
services certifications, I can learn DevOps. But no, here's what everyone should realize if they are 
developing web applications.

- Your web app, specifically the backend where APIs and business logic resides, **is inherintly slow 
during traffic spikes** _(when there's 10+ users requesting resources at the same time)_. If you want to address 
the slowness of your applications, you have to learn some basic DevOps concepts. 


- Online courses/certifications often only provide a lot of theory and instructions on using specific 
cloud-based tools but lack practical and real-world scenarios. So, you have to waste lots of your time 
filtering out irrelevant concepts that don't help you on achieving your goal. What's worse is, you don't 
have any strong reason why you decided to learn DevOps in the first place _(don't be like me pls 😭)_. 

But, let's be real here. The problem starts with, developers don't see performance issues until it's too late. 
Typically, after the development is done, they'll just deploy it on some platform and never 
experience getting high traffic on their web app, or, if they do get a high traffic, they are left wondering.. 
_"Why the server is crashing?"_, _"Why do requests were timing out?"_. Let's change that! I'll show you an easy way, 
for you to experience how slow your app is 😈.
