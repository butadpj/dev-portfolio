The hate for NextJS and/or Vercel usually comes from developers who don't actually know what
problems these tools solve. Well, I don't really blame them, as I was once a hater, before
I fully understand what Vercel is trying to solve. 

All you need to do, before you start hating on NextJS again, is **ask your self a question**...

## [When do you really need to use NextJS?](#when-do-you-really-need-to-use-nextjs)

Guess what? You don't need to force NextJS onto a project where it's not a good fit.
Now, how can you determine if you'll **benefit from using** NextJS or it's just going 
to **make everything complicated?**  

<InfoCard
  text="Since we're talking about NextJS here, I'll assume you've already built some 
  apps/sites with React or at least, you're already familiar with it."
/>

### ðŸš« You don't need NextJS if... 
- **You're building static or simple sites**: Clearly, (HTML|CSS|JS) is enough for static
sites. Even when your site needs a little bit of dynamic features, tools like 
[Astro](https://astro.build/) or [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org) is more appropriate than NextJS. 

- **You haven't used React (or other component-based UI framework)**: The truth is, devs who 
enjoy using NextJS, also love building their UIs with React! The composability of React is 
what makes it great, however, its greatness is limited to client-side environemnt only. 
If only, there's a way to bring React's composability on server environment? ðŸ¤” ifykyk lol.

### ðŸŸ  You probably need NextJS if... 
- **You're building apps with React**: If you're not sure whether your little app will stay
as it is now, or soon, will be having more features. It's just a matter of time, trust me. 
You're going to need ways to handle data fetching, user auth, real-time updates, or maybe 
you realize you need to do SEO. The complexity of these features will start to affect 
React's composability that can result to a messy codebase if you don't know what 
you're doing.

### âœ… You really need NextJS if... 
- **You want to ship features, not build an infrastructure**: Vercel goal is to let devs 
focus on shipping features while enjoying the DX their tools provide. Starting from NextJS, 
which took React at its best, by not making our codebase complicated once we start adding 
features that works best if you have access to server environment (ex. _data fetching_, _user auth_, _SSR for dynamic contents_, etc.).
Additionally, Vercel offers a **no-config way deployments** for your apps. Imagine 
just importing your project's repository and after few clicks, BOOM! App is instantly 
deployed (with CI/CD already configured).

Let's dive a little deeper on how NextJS and Vercel actually works together. This will allow
us to understand these tools really well and start making better decisions. But first, a 
little bit of history is needed to prepare you for the deep dive ðŸŒŠ.

Previously, when developing complex web applications we're only bound to choose between two (2)
approaches. Either you do client-side rendering (SPA) or you do server-side rendering (SSR).
Both have pros and cons, but, what we've learned after years of struggling to choose between 
these two approach are... 
- Isn't it nice to have access to both client-side and server-side environment when 
developing our applications. Yes! A **hybrid approach!** 
- No matter which approach I choose, I'll always develop my UIs **using React!** (or maybe
other component-based UI frameworks).

Now, it makes sense why NextJS easily became one of the most popular frameworks. 
It's not just a hype, NextJS literally makes our dreams come true. So, let's dive-in deep on 
how NextJS and Vercel provides the best DX for developing and managing our complex web 
applications. Starting off with..

{/* But, let me warn you first, with great power comes with great responsibility.  */}

{/* Now, . Let's now dive-in deep on how NextJS does this, 
but, I'll focus more on NextJS 14 (where they introduced the App router and React Server Components). 
Because I think, the DX before NextJS 14 was really not great. */}

### NextJS giving React an access to server 
- Before the introduction of React Server Components (RSC), NextJS  offers 
<span class="not-prose">`getServerSideProps`</span>, 
<span class="not-prose">`getStaticProps`</span>, 
and <span class="not-prose">`getStaticPaths`</span> for accessing the server environment. 
- Now, with NextJS App router + RSC, you don't have to worry about non-React ways just
to have an access to the server because, by default, all of your components are rendered
on the server.

- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CN9RCzznZc" target="_blank">This talk from Sam</a> 
explains how rendering React on the server makes developing complex UIs feels like 
you're just building a lego ðŸ§©.
