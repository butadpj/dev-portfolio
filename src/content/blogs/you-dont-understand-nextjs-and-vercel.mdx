The hate for NextJS and/or Vercel usually comes from developers who don't actually know what
problems these tools solve. Well, I don't really blame them, as I was once a hater, before
I fully understand what Vercel is trying to solve. 

All you need to do, before you start hating on these tools again, is **ask your self a question**...

## [When do you really need to use NextJS?](#when-do-you-really-need-to-use-nextjs)

Guess what? You don't need to force NextJS onto a project where it's not a good fit.
Now, how can you determine if you'll **benefit from using** NextJS or it's just going 
to **make everything complicated?**  

<InfoCard
  text="Since we're talking about NextJS here, I'll assume you've already built some 
  apps/sites with React or at least, you're already familiar with it."
/>

### ðŸš« You don't need NextJS if... 
- **You're building static or simple sites**: Clearly, HTML, CSS, and JS is enough for static
sites. Even when your site needs a little bit of dynamic features and maybe you want to have some
structure on your codebase, tools like [Astro](https://astro.build/) or [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org) 
are more appropriate than NextJS. 

- **You haven't used React (or other component-based UI framework)**: The truth is, devs who 
enjoy using NextJS, also love building their UIs with React! The composability of React is 
what makes it great, however, its greatness is limited to client-side environemnt only. 
If only, there's a way to bring React's composability on server environment? ðŸ¤” ifykyk lol.

### ðŸŸ  You probably need NextJS if... 
- **You're building apps with React**: If you're not sure whether your little app will stay
as it is now, or soon, will be having more features. It's just a matter of time, trust me. 
You're going to need ways to handle data fetching, user auth, real-time updates, or maybe 
you realize you need to do SEO. The complexity of these features will start to affect 
React's composability that can result to a messy codebase if you don't know what 
you're doing.

### âœ… You really need NextJS if... 
- **You want to ship features, not build an infrastructure**: Vercel goal is to let devs 
focus on shipping features while enjoying the DX their tools provide. Starting from NextJS, 
which took React at its best, by not making our codebase complicated once we start adding 
features that works best if you have access to server environment (ex. _data fetching_, _user auth_, _SSR for dynamic contents_, etc.).
Additionally, when you get to deployments, Vercel allows developers to have _infrastructureless_ code. Imagine being able to deploy
your app in just a few clicks and not worry about making your infrastructure high-performant, scalable,
and secured. All of that DevOps stuffs is being taken care of Vercel.

Let's dive a little deeper on how NextJS and Vercel actually works together. This will allow
us to understand these tools really well and start making better decisions. But first, a 
little bit of history is needed to prepare you for the deep dive ðŸŒŠ.

Previously, when developing complex web applications we're only bound to choose between two (2)
approaches. Either you do client-side rendering (SPA) or you do server-side rendering (SSR).
Both have pros and cons, but, what we've learned after years of struggling to choose between 
these two approach are... 
- Isn't it nice to have access to both client-side and server-side environment when 
developing our applications. Yes! A **hybrid approach!** 
- No matter which approach I choose, I'll always develop my UIs **using React!** (or maybe
other component-based UI frameworks).

Now, it makes sense why NextJS easily became one of the most popular frameworks. It's not 
just hype, it's just NextJS makes it very for us to mix-and-match different approaches on 
serving our pages. So, let's dive-in deep on how NextJS and Vercel provides the best DX for 
developing and managing web applications. Starting off with..

{/* But, let me warn you first, with great power comes with great responsibility.  */}

{/* Now, . Let's now dive-in deep on how NextJS does this, 
but, I'll focus more on NextJS 14 (where they introduced the App router and React Server Components). 
Because I think, the DX before NextJS 14 was really not great. */}

### NextJS giving React an access to server 
- Before the introduction of React Server Components (RSC), NextJS  offers 
<span class="not-prose">`getServerSideProps`</span>, 
<span class="not-prose">`getStaticProps`</span>, 
and <span class="not-prose">`getStaticPaths`</span> for accessing the server environment. 
_Not really a fan of these as it breaks everything I love about React (the composability and 
data encapsulation of components)_.

- Now, with NextJS App router + RSC, you don't have to worry about non-React ways just
to have an access to the server, because, by default, all of your components are rendered
on the server.

- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CN9RCzznZc" target="_blank">This talk from Sam</a> 
explains how rendering React components on the server makes developing complex UIs feels like 
you're just building a lego ðŸ§©. 

### Vercel's framework-defined infrastructure

- NextJS' predictable pattern of marking a page to be rendered on client or server, or even 
generating it on build time, can be mapped on to appropriate infrastructure. The framework is 
flexible enough to support all these approach of serving the pages, unfortunately, there's a 
price for too much flexibility, and that's going to be **a very complicated infrastructure**.

- Vercel combines different cloud services such as static file service, API gateway, serverless, 
and other more to achieve this whole framework-defined infrastructure. The result? Huge smiles 
from developers because they don't have to worry about making their infrastructures high-performant,
scalable, and secure - a truly _infrastructureless_. 

### The ugly parts

Let's start off with the obvious ones. 

- **Vendor locked-in**: At the time of writing, the only platform I trust for having 
_infrastructureless_  code are **Vercel**, **AWS Amplify**, and **Netlify** 
(with its Next.js Runtime v5). 

  - _This is going to be your root problem if you use NextJS without planning to have your 
  infrastructure managed by the platforms I just mentioned above_.
  - _You can always self-host tho (see 
  <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying#self-hosting" target="_blank">NextJS self-hosting options</a>), 
  and take the responsibility of managing and scaling your own infrastructure. I think that's 
  inevitable once your app starts to have tons of user_. 

## [Conclusion](#conclusion)

It's easy to hate on NextJS and Vercel if we don't try to understand their purpose. The great DX 
that comes from these tools has definitely a price to be paid. Those who really want to ship 
features and not build an infrastructure, I supposed they are ready to pay the price. For those 
who can't tolerate being vendor locked-in on to limited platforms, you don't have to force yourself
to use NextJS and hate it because of the problems you'll encounter.

Starting today, let this words from a wise programmer be part of our mantra - 
"_There's really no solutions for a problem, only tradeoffs_".
